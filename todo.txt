To Do
================================================================================

 - Game logic should generate weather, calculate results and increase current year
    - yield = (heat * heatFactor) * (wetness * wetnessFactor) * fertility
    - CONSIDER: This formula actually makes heatFactor and wetnessFactor pointless;
        they are just multiplied together in this calculation into a single value!

 - pollInput should prompt user for input until all fields are filled (which crop in field 1... etc)

 - Have ability to purchase additional fields - some better than others, e.g. soil quality vs area tradeoff?
    - Having different areas and no ability to mix crops forces investment tradeoffs

 - Ensure the properties of our crops are actually realistic?
 - Use crop descriptions in-game? // this is a great idea, can help tie the crop performance to real life
