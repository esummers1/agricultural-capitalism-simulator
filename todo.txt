================================================================================
To Do
================================================================================

 - pollInput should prompt user for input until all fields are filled (which crop in field 1... etc)

 - Ability to purchase additional fields

 - Ensure the properties of our crops are actually realistic?

 - The weather/yield results should be 'remembered' for reporting to player

 - Need to have way of assigning a Field object a Crop object

================================================================================
Ideas
================================================================================

 - Use crop descriptions in-game? // this is a great idea, can help tie the crop performance to real life
 
 - Varying field properties, e.g. size / soil quality   // Dan: I like it!
    - Having different areas and no ability to mix crops forces investment tradeoffs
