To Do
================================================================================

 - pollInput results must be completed

 - Ability to purchase additional fields

 - The weather/yield results should be 'remembered' for reporting to player

 - Update/balance crop properties to match descriptions - do some maths to figure realistic yields

 - Balancing of starting capital vs. crop profits

================================================================================
Ideas
================================================================================

 - Varying field properties, e.g. size / soil quality   // Dan: I like it!
    - Having different areas and no ability to mix crops forces investment tradeoffs
