To Do
================================================================================

 - Revise crop yield algorithm
  - Currently both factors are additive - is suboptimal for e.g. crops which
    are sensitive to rain

 - Report performance of fields in turn so you have insight

 - Balance crops
 - Adding more crops

 - Unit tests
 
 - Access field descriptions after buying them
 
 - Press ENTER appears twice after entering junk input / buying 0 of a crop
 
 - No way to cancel crop purchase
