To Do
================================================================================

 - Field class: crop ID, volume
 - New fields in Game object: money, current year, list of fields
 - Game logic should generate weather, calculate results and increase current year
    - yield = (heat * heatFactor) * (wetness * wetnessFactor) * fertility
    - CONSIDER: This formula actually makes heatFactor and wetnessFactor pointless;
        they are just multiplied together in this calculation into a single value!
 - pollInput should prompt user for input until all fields are filled (which crop in field 1... etc)
 - Ensure the properties of our crops are actually realistic?
 - Use crop descriptions in-game?
