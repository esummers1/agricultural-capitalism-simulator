To Do
================================================================================

 - Endgame condition e.g. score evaluation after 10 years
 - Handle user inputting strings when program expects an integer
 - Add ability to sell fields, as a cash injection?
 - Perhaps make a method similar to waitForEnter which includes a return line,
    for returning to menu?

 - Revise crop yield algorithm - perhaps factor sun in, too?
  - Currently both factors are additive - is suboptimal for e.g. crops which
    are sensitive to rain

 - Balance crops
 - Adding more crops

 - Unit tests

 - Dynamic actions list instead of harcoded
