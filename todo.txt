To Do
================================================================================

 - Revise crop yield algorithm
  - Currently both factors are additive - is suboptimal for e.g. crops which
    are sensitive to rain

 - Report performance of fields in turn so you have insight

 - Balance crops
 - Adding more crops

 - Unit tests
