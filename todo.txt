To Do
================================================================================

 - Randomise weather / heat using a bell curve
   - Revise reportWeather bounds once done
 - Balance crops
 - Adding more crops
 - Endgame condition e.g. score evaluation after 10 years
 - Unit tests
 - Handle user inputting strings when program expects an integer
 - [Issue] waitForEnter seems not to be waiting for ENTER?
 - Add ability to sell fields, as a cash injection
 - Perhaps make a method similar to waitForEnter which includes a return line,
    for returning to menu?
